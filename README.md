# CS217B-ndnSIM-Scratch

Put all simulations (.cc) files in this directory and running ./waf should automatically build the simulation. If you include the optimize flag then I think debugging wont show, so don't do that for testing purposes.

Check out ndnsim.net/2.1/examples/html for good examples, we probably can just do the 9 grid example, but with our own needs.
